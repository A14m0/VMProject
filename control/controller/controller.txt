Controller listening on a port:
	1) needs to be able to adapt to different kinds of control schemes
		a) Tester controller, just like last time sits there until the timer runs out
		b) Random tester, needs to be able to randomly select different sub-programs to run and randomly select times to do nothing (maybe run 2 programs at the same time even)
			i) Maybe some different profiles?

Make sure that everyone has a copy of the data collection c++ program and in the end uploads all csv to host
